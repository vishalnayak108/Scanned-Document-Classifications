ATTACHMENT

Kenneth Lipper (“K. Lipper”) owns a majority of the shares of Lipper & Company, Inc. (“Lipper Inc.”), a
Delaware corporation, and a majority of the member interests of Lipper Holdings, LLC (“Lipper
Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company. Lipper Inc. is the general partner of Lipper &
Company, L.P. (“Lipper L.P.”), a Delaware limited partnership, and the manager of Lipper Holdings.
Lipper L.P. is the investment manager of a number of limited partnerships. Lipper Holdings is the general
partner of a number of limited partnerships, some of which are or may be deemed to be “institutional
investment managers” for the purposes of the reporting requirements under Section 13(f) of the Act,
including Lipper Convertibles, L.P. (“Lipper Convertibles”). K. Lipper is the majority shareholder of
Jerome Service Corp. LDC (“Jerome Services”), a Cayman Islands limited duration company, which is the
general partner of a number of limited partnerships. K. Lipper, by virtue of his relationship to the
aforementioned entities, may be deemed to exercise investment discretion with respect to the Section 13(f)
securities held directly and indirectly by such entities, but K. Lipper disclaims investment discretion with
respect to such Section 13(f) securities for all other purposes. To the extent that K. Lipper’s interest in the
aforementioned entities may nevertheless give rise to a Form 13F filing obligation for K. Lipper, the
information required by Form 13F is reported herein on behalf of certain entities which are themselves
institutional investment managers subject to Section 13(f) of the Act. In that regard, the Section 13(f)
securities positions of Jerome Services, Lipper Inc., Lipper L.P., Lipper Convertibles, and Lipper Holdings
are included in this Form 13F-HR report by K. Lipper on behalf of himself and each such entity.

U.S.C 77d(6).

When toFile: A notice must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering. A notice is deemed filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) on the earlier of the date it is received by the SEC at the address given below or, if received at that address after the date on which it is
due, on the date it was mailed by United States registered or certified mail to that address.

Where to File: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

Copies Required: Five (5) copies of this notice must be filed with the SEC, one of which must be manually signed. Any copies not manually signed must be
photocopies of the manually signed copy or bear typed or printed signatures.

the SEC.

Filing Fee: There is no federal filing fee.

State:

that have adopted this form. Issuers relying on ULOE must file a separate notice with the Securities Administrator in each state where sales are to be, or have been
made. If a state requires the payment of a fee as a precondition to the claim for the exemption, a fee in the proper amount shall accompany this form. This notice shall

RE: Prime Brokerage Arrangements between Broker-Dealers & Certain Investment Advisors

 

Dear Mr. Hennessy: i

This is in response to your letter of December 27, 1999, in which you request that the
Division of Market Regulation grant a permanent extension of the July 9, 1997 no-action letter
regarding the treatment of prime broker arrangements for broker-dealers that engage in prime
brokerage activities with certain investment advisers that are no longer required to be registered
under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Adviser’s Letter”)'.

The Adviser’s Letter extended the no action relief, granted under Sections 7, 10, Li(d), :
1S(c)(3), and 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”),” Rules 10a-1, 10b- i
10, if(d)(1), 15c3-1, 15¢3-3, 17a-3 and 17a-4 thereunder, 3 and Regulation T, provided by the :
Division’s January 25, 1994 prime brokerage letter (“Prime Broker Letter”). The Adviser’s }
Letter states that Division will not recommend enforcement action through December PROCESSED

« .
In letters dated December 30, 1997° and December 23, 1998,’ the Division extended the no
action relief granted in the Adviser’s Letter until December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1999
respectively. You now request that the Division grant permanent status to the relief granted in
the Adviser’s Letter.

The Division believes that the relief granted in the Advisors Letter should be extended
permanently. Accordingly, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the
Cornmission under Sections 7, 10, 11(d), 15(c)(3), and 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”), Rules 10a-1, 10b-10, 11(d)(1), 15¢3-1, 15c3-3, 17a-3 and 17a-4
thereunder, and Regulation T, if a broker dealer engages in prime brokerage activities as
described in the Prime Broker Letter with certain investment advisers that, subject to the
Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act® are no longer required to be registered under
Section 203 of the Adviser’s Act.

This is a staff position with respect to enforcement only and does not represent a Icgal
conclusion regarding the application of the federal securities laws. This position is based solely
on the representations which have been made to the Division. Any different facts might require a
different response. Furthermore, this position may be withdrawn or modified at any time if the
Division determines that such action is necessary in the public interest, for the protection of
investors, or otherwise, in furtherance of the purposes of the federal securities laws.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Dudek: Lg aber oe

Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. (the ''Company'') — Rule 12g3-2(b) Exemption

The following information is presented on behalf of the Company, a joint stock limited liability
company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China with limited liability, in order to obtain the
exemption from Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) provided
pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act to foreign private issuers.

1. Equity Securities Information

The Company has informed us that its authorized, issued and fully paid share capital as at the date
hereof consists of 2,909,260,000 domestic shares and 1,433,854,500 H shares, with par value of
Renminbi 1.00 each.

All of the domestic shares of the Company are currently held by Zhejiang Provincial High Class
Highway Investment Company Limited, a Chinese state-owned enterprise. The H shares of the
Company have a primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and secondary listings on the
London Stock Exchange and the Berliner Wertpapierbérse (the “Unofficial Regulated Market of the
Berlin Stock Exchange’)

The most recent public distribution by the Company of its equity shares occurred in May 1997 when
the Company distributed all of its H shares to international investors outside the mainland of China
and listed its H shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In connection with such distribution, the
Company prepared an offering circular to offer its H shares to qualified institutional buyers in the
United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. We have been informed by the
Company that it has been unable to confirm how many H shares were sold in the United States.

The Company has advised us that it is not possible, without unreasonable effort and expense, for the
Company to know the number of holders of its H shares who are residents of the United States
because the H shares have a primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and secondary listines.

 — Listing of shares
in Billerud AB (publ)

 

The Annual General Meeting of AssiDoman AB on 22 May 2001 decided to distribute all the
shares in Billerud AB held by AssiDoman AB to its shareholders. Billerud was created through
a merger of Stora Enso’s paper and pulp mill Gruvén and AssiDom4n’s paper and pulp mills
Karlsborg and Skarblacka. Initially, Stora Enso and AssiDoman held SO per cent each of the
shares in Billerud AB. Since Stora Enso has exercised its right to divest 20 per cent of the shares
in Billerud AB to AssiDomin AB, AssiDoman AB will hold 70 per cent of the shares in Billerud

e AB, all of which will be distributed. The distribution will be implemented in accordance with
so-called Lex ASEA rules and, according to an advance decision of the National Tax Board,
therefore will not result in any taxation for AssiDoméan AB or its shareholders in Sweden.

The. listing of shares in Billerud AB on the O-list of Stockholmsbérsen is expected as of 20

November 2001. The record date for the shareholders in AssiDoméan AB for entitlement to a
distribution of shares in Billerud AB is 16 November 2001.

i With respect to Billerud’s present financial development and conditions, and its financial
e objectives, the dividend for fiscal year 2001 should, in the opinion of the Board of Directors
of Billerud AB, amount to SEK 3.50 per share, or in total approximately SEK 220 million, see
also section Financial objectives and dividend policy on page 42. Furthermore, the Board of
Directors of Billerud AB intend to propose that the Annual General Meeting in 2002 author-
; ise the Board of Directors to decide on repurchase of shares in Billerud AB.

: As a service co the shareholder that owns a small number of shares in Billerud, the Board

of Directors of Billerud AB consider offering the shareholders the opportunity to sell a small

number of shares:free of commission at a suitable time during the first half of 2002. Such a

e procedure would also enable Billerud to obtain a shareholder structure that is more suitable
i to a company the size of Billerud.

 

i The Board of Directors of Billerud AB, which is responsible for the contents of the listing

: particulars, hereby confirms that to the best of its knowledge the information in these listing

' particulars accurately reflects actual conditions and that nothing of material importance has
been omitted that could influence the perception of Billerud created by the listing particulars.

Re: KAS Depository Trust Company (“KDTC”) ,

Dear Mr. Smits: °

This letter responds to your letter of October 19, 2001, following up on two telephone
conversations of October 5, 2001, between you and Steve Packs and Evan Geldzahler, both of
the Division of Investment Management (“Division”). Your letter provides your summary of the
substance of those conversations regarding the request of your client, KDTC, for no-action relief. -

As I informed you during those conversations, the policy of this Division is to not issue
no-action or interpretive letters in areas in which the staff has already addressed a particular
issue.| More specifically, } informed you that the Division would not issue a separate letter to
KDTC because we had already addressed issues relating to whether a special purpose
corporation, formed under the laws of the Netherlands as part of the Vabef II system, could act as
an eligible foreign custodian in accordance with Rule 17f-5.’ -

' See Investment Company Act Release No. 22587 (March 27, 1997), at note 20 (noting that “{t}he Division of
Investment Management generally permits third parties to rely on no-action or interpretive letters to the extent that
the third party’s facts and circumstances are substantially similar to those described in the underlying request for a
no-action or interpretive Jetter.”). .

* See ING Bank N.V., et al, (pub. avail. May 24, 1999). The Division limits additional no-action or interpretive

letters to situations in which the subsequent submission highlights material differences with positions already taken
by the Division, and satisfactorily explains why such differences necessitate further Division consideration.

“Company’’), we are furnishing this letter which contains certain additional information
requested by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) with

required by the exemption relating to certain foreign securities pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule
12g3-2 (the “Rule”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange

contained in the letter previously submitted by the Company to the Commission on December

Company using information obtained through an investor survey, there were approximately 35
holders who identified themselves as being located in the United States (each a “U.S. holder’).
